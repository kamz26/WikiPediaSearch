# WikiPediaSearch

- Parse JSON from the API response.
- Each list item should contain an image and appropriate data from the API. Show whichever fields you think are necessary.
- Clicking a list item launches the respective Wikipedia page within the app.
- The UI specification is left to you. Use appropriate UX and UI widgets to give the best experience as you see fit. (For example, you could give search suggestions, update results as the user types etc.)
- Caching responses to give a good offline experience.
